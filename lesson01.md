# Day One: Embarking on the Journey to Software Engineering

Hello everyone! Today marks the very first day of my journey into the world of software engineering. I'm excited to commit at least **one hour daily** to learning and growing in this field. Whether you're just starting out or looking for some motivation, I hope you'll find these reflections and notes inspiring and helpful.

## The Essentials

To begin, all you need is a **text editor** and a **web browser**. These simple tools will be your companions as you dive into coding. Our instructor, Leon, hails from the US, so many examples and analogies will have a relatable, American twist.

## Why Become a Software Engineer?

There are countless reasons to take the plunge into software engineering, and here are some of the key ones:

- **It's the modern gold rush.**  
  The tech industry is booming with opportunities.

- **High Pay.**  
  Average salaries range between 90k-100k USD, making it a lucrative career choice.

- **Happiest Job.**  
  Many find great satisfaction and joy in solving problems and building innovative solutions.

- **No Degree Required.**  
  The beauty of this field is that anyone can learn for free—formal education isn’t the only path.

However, a word of caution: merely learning to code doesn't automatically land you a job. Many people complete bootcamps or university courses and still struggle in the practical world of software development. **Practical experience, networking, and continuous learning are essential.** Remember: when you're job hunting, simply clicking “apply” is like printing out a resume only to burn it. **Networking is key**—get to know people in the industry!

## The Trough of Sorrow

One of the most honest parts of this journey is what I like to call the **Trough of Sorrow**. It’s that period when you’re learning relentlessly, accumulating many Udemy courses and tutorials, yet still feeling like you're not making tangible progress.

**How do you get through it?**

- **Embrace the Wiggles of False Hope.**  
  You might land some interviews and face rejections. Imagine applying to 60 positions where only 20% yield any interest. It’s normal to be discouraged, but don’t lose hope!

- **Keep Engaging.**  
  Stay connected with the community, seek advice, and encourage others as well. When you eventually land a job, make it a point to help someone else along the way.

- **Pace Yourself.**  
  Remember, becoming a software engineer is a marathon, not a sprint. Manage frustration, maintain consistency, and take care of yourself. Even if what you’re learning today seems meaningless, it will make sense tomorrow.

- **Avoid Burnout.**  
  Instead of setting overly ambitious daily goals, start with **1 hour a day** (or 2 on weekends, maxing out at 4-5 hours). Consistency is more important than intensity.

## Course Setup Overview

Here’s what you can expect from our course:

- **No Prior Coding Experience Required.**
- **3 Weeks of Foundational Simplicity.**
- **All Materials on Discord.**  
  Find everything in the `#Follow-Along-Materials` channel.
- **Networking Opportunities.**  
  Engage with 3 individuals already in tech and participate in 2 coffee chats weekly to hear real-life experiences.
- **Homework Assignments.**  
  After each class, assignments will be submitted first via Google Forms and then on GitHub.
- **Daily Coding Challenges.**  
  Once you master a command in JS or Python, challenges will help solidify your learning.
- **Full Stack Focus.**  
  We’ll cover Full Stack JavaScript, including HTML, CSS, JS, Node, React, and MongoDB. No strict syllabus—learn organically without overloading yourself.
  
Two crucial strategies for accelerated and lasting learning are:

1. **Active Recall**
2. **Spaced Repetition**

### Homework Videos

To kickstart these techniques, watch these two videos:

- [How to Study for Exams: Evidence-Based Revision Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE)
- [How to Study for Exams: Spaced Repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM)

**Pro Tip:** Use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for spaced repetition.  

- **Create your own cards:** Customization helps retention.
- **Use it daily:** Build the habit.
- **Engage deeply:** Resist the urge to simply flip for the answer.

## Diving into the Technical Stuff

### What is the Internet?

At its core, the internet is a network of computers that communicate with each other. There are two main types of computers in this ecosystem:

- **Servers:**  
  These computers serve content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to clients.
  
- **Clients:**  
  These are your computers (or devices) that request data from the server. Programs like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge act as browsers that fetch and display the content.

**An Analogy:**  
Think of a restaurant:

- **Client:** You, who asks for the menu.
- **Server:** The restaurant that provides the menu and takes your order, handling everything from processing payments to managing orders.

In web development:

- **Frontend Developers** focus on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Developers** handle server-side operations with tools like Node, Python, or Ruby.
- **Full Stack Developers** work on both ends.

When you make a request via your browser, your data travels through a series of steps:

1. **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** Connects you to the internet.
2. **DNS (Domain Name System):** Acts as the internet's phonebook, converting domain names to IP addresses.
3. **Server Processing:** The server executes code, accesses databases, and sends back data in various formats (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

This communication happens through protocols like **HTTP** and **HTTPS** (the secure version).

### A Glimpse into HTML5

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, the language that structures websites. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) sets the standards for HTML5, introducing new tags like `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, and APIs for geolocation and WebSockets.

**The Golden Rule of Web Development:**  

- **HTML:** Content & structure (the skeleton of your website).
- **CSS:** Style (the visual design).
- **JS:** Behavior (interaction and dynamics).

**For example:**

- To add a paragraph, you use HTML:

  ```html
  <p class="nice">Hello World</p>
  ```
