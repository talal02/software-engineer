## üåç Learn - CSS Fundamentals

- CSS is the language for styling web pages and it stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
Where does CSS go?
- CSS can go in a separate file or in the `<head>` of an HTML file or maybe even inline with the HTML.
- Why you should put styles in head?
- Only if you work at Amazon, why? every time you load a page, the browser has to download the CSS file, so if you have a lot of CSS, it can slow down the page load time. Whatever comes in first fold of website should be in head to reduce the load time. Everything else can go in the separate file.
- It's the best practice to put CSS in a separate file.
How?
- You can link the CSS file in the head of the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
```
- We are going into css folder, from where our current html file is, and then we are going into styles.css file.

### CSS Syntax
- It's a markup language, so it has a specific syntax.
- It consists of a selector, property, and value.
- Here's an example:
```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
- Here `p` is the selector, which selects the HTML element you want to style.
- `color` is the property, which is the style you want to apply.
- `red` is the value, which is the color you want to apply.
- You're writing a rule here, which is a combination of property and value.
- Each rule has a declaration block, which is the property and value inside the curly braces `{}`.
- You can have multiple declarations in a rule.
- You can have multiple rules in a CSS file.
- In above example rule, we have two declarations, one declaration is `color: red;` and other is `font-size: 16px;`. These are two declarations in a declaration block, and this declaration block is inside the curly braces `{}`. This is a rule.
- This can be asked in interview, what is a rule? A rule is a combination of property and value, and it has a declaration block inside the curly braces `{}`.

- CSS is read from top to bottom, so if you have two rules that conflict, the one that comes last will be applied.
- This is called the **Cascading** part of CSS.
- This is why it's called Cascading Style Sheets.
```css
p {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: blue;
}
```
- In above example, the color of the paragraph will be blue, because the last rule is `color: blue;`.

### Let's learn simple CSS
- Color
- 4 Main Ways to color in CSS
  - Color Name
  - Hex Code
  - RGB
  - HSL
```css
p {
  color: yellow; # Color Name
}
p {
  color: #ffff00; # Hex Code
}
p {
  color: rgb(255, 255, 0); # RGB
}
p {
  color: hsl(75, 50%, 50%); # HSL
}
```
- Using only color name will end up with limited colors, so we use hex code, RGB, and HSL.
- Professionaly rgba and hex color are most used.

- Font Family
- html
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto">
</head>
```
- css
```css
p {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```

- You shall always have link tag before the css file link tag in the head of the html file. Again cascading, if you have css file link tag before the link tag of the font, then the font will not be applied.
- Fall back font is `sans-serif`, if the font is not available, then the browser will use the `sans-serif` font.
- Go to fonts.google.com, select a font, and then copy the link tag and paste it in the head of the html file in order to use that font.
- Make sure to have weight of the font, if you want to use a specific weight of the font, then you can add that in the link tag. For speed you should use only the weight you need.

- Need Help with CSS?
- Use MDN Web Docs, it's the best resource for CSS.
- How to research CSS?
- Google "concept name + MDN", and you will get the MDN link.
- Also, you can use https://learn.shayhowe.com, it's a great resource for learning CSS.

### Let's Code
- Download the class04 materials from this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nb5QadNC2Z1x2oqH9zIMZFVbYjarM5Br/view
- Open the class04 folder in VS Code.
- For the first week, forget about live server, just open the html file in the browser and save the changes in the html file and refresh the browser to see the changes.

### Selecting By Relationship
- Direct Parent / Child Relationship
```html
<section>
  <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
</section>
```
```css
section > p {
  color: red;
}
```
- In above example, we are selecting the `p` tag which is a child of `section` tag. This is called parent / child selector.
- `>` is the child selector.

- Parent / Child Relationship
```html
<section>
  <article>
    <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
  </article>
</section>
```
```css
section p {
  color: red;
}
```
- In above example, we are selecting the `p` tag which is a child of `section` tag. This is called parent / child selector.
- p is not a direct child of section, but it is a child of article which is a child of section, so this is called parent / child selector.
- There is a space between `section` and `p`, this is called parent / child selector.

- Previous Sibling / Next Sibling
```html
<section>
  <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
  <p>Hello, Youtube!</p>
</section>
```
```css
p + p {
  color: red;
}
```
- In above example, we are selecting the second `p` tag which is a sibling of the first `p` tag. This is called previous sibling / next sibling selector.
- `+` is the sibling selector.

### Back to code
- Open the class04 folder in VS Code.
- Relationship-CSS folder.

### Classes & IDs
- We got to be more specific with our CSS.
- ID: `#`
- Id is unique, you can only have one id on a page.
```html
<section>
  <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
  <p id="zebra">Hello, Youtube!</p>
</section>
```
```css
#zebra {
  color: red;
}
```
- In above example, we are selecting the `p` tag which has an id of `zebra`. This is called id selector.
- Class: `.`
- Class is not unique, you can have multiple classes on a page.
```html
<section>
  <p class="robot">Hello, Twitch!</p>
  <p class="bob" id="zebra">Hello, Youtube!</p>
  <p class="bob">Hello, Mixer!</p>
</section>
```
```css
.bob {
  color: red;
}
#zebra {
  color: blue;
}
```
- In above example, we are selecting the `p` tag which has a class of `bob`. This is called class selector.
- In above example, we are selecting the `p` tag which has an id of `zebra`. This is called id selector.
- You can have multiple classes on a tag, but you can only have one id on a tag.
- This css will make the color of the `p` tag with class `bob` to red and the color of the `p` tag with id `zebra` to blue.

- IDs have 100 points, classes have 10 points, and elements have 1 point.
- Other !important, Inline, and Inline Styles have 1000 points.
- The more points you have, the more specific you are.


- Why its not good to use inline styles?
- Because it's hard to override them. Inline styles have 1000 points, so you need to have 1001 points to override them.
- Inline styles are the most specific, so they are hard to override.
